# Quizzical in React

The Quizzical app written in React 18

## Description

Another final project from Scrimba, you are presented a mockup and need to build a working solution that fetches from the OpenTriviaDb project. This was a great learning experience, pulling from the API, modeling the data. I got a chance to learn and use some Tailwind CSS and the HTML encoding and decoding libraries. The app itself pulls a list of questions from TheOpenTrivia api and presents it to the user. Once the user guesses, it will show which was correct, incorrect and allow the user to restart. I found this project fairly straight forward to build. I did however end up spending a bit of time thinking about what concrete classes were needed to model the data.

## Live Demo
